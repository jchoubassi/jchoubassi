Hello, 

I have a previous degree in Psychology and am not working on a second degree in CompSci
I have a big interest in AI and ML, but I consider myself a beginner and have not delved deep into that field yet.
Right now I am focusing on C++ and python, but I have some background in webdev as well (HTML, CSS, JS). I plan to focus on C++ and python, as well as learn SQL and Java, to start.
I will post any projects I use to learn and things I work on in school, so please critique as you will!

Thanks :)
