Hello, I'm Jenny! I am fairly new to programming as I have been learning poython over the past year. I have a BSc  in Pychology but in my last couple of years I took some classes that introduced me to AI and became interested in incorporating my knowledge on the brain into my projects.
I am focusing on building my skills in Python and HTML and am interested in a focus in machine learning and AI and how I can put together programming and my passion for the processes of the brain to build systems that can be used in academia or businesses.

These days I'm working on small website builds and am planning to develop my portfolio on my own website (think a portfolio within a portfolio?) and have been developing small games in Python, however I have begun small automation projects like weather fetchers and sending emails from python.
I hope to be able to work on large scale projects this year that I can start to build an emphasis around my field of interest.

Check out some of the stuff I post with any criticism and/or ideas, I am always open to expanding my knowledge!
